            <dt><strong>2013 -> 2017 ::: Bachelor's of Science in Physics</strong></dt>
            <dd>From 2013 to 2018 I've studied to obtain my B.Sc. in Physics at Universit√† degli Studi di Catania.<br>
                It has been a wonderful experience from which I still have lots of good memories.<br>
                Among the courses I've taken during my B.Sc. one could find <em>Classical Electrodynamics</em>,
                <em>Quantum Mechanics</em>,<em>Nuclear Physics</em> and <em>Astrophysics</em>.<br>My thesis work
                revolved around the study of <em>Transparent Conductive Oxides for Flexible Electronics</em>.

            <dt><strong>2018 -> 2021 ::: Master's of Science in Complex Systems Physics</strong></dt>
            <dd>After my time in Catania I moved to Pisa to graduate in Complex System Physics.<br>
                During these years I've taken courses such as <em>Nonlinear Dynamics</em>, <em>Neuronal Dyanimics</em>,
                <em>Complex Systems</em> and <em>Computing Methods for Experimental Physics and Data Analysys</em> in
                which I've encountered for the very first time Machine Learning; this class helped me to become more
                aware of my coding abilities thanks to a final project involving the writing of a code for a better
                localization of microcalcifications in mammograms.<hr>
