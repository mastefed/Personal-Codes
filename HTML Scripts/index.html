    <p>
        This is myself, well, it was myself when and where that photo was taken, right?
        I'm a 27 years old guy from Italy.

        But who am I? I am:

        <li>Passionate about <strong>tech</strong> stuff and <strong>innovation</strong></li>
        <li>Always <strong>striving</strong> for new things to learn</li>
        <li>Always trying to <strong>create</strong> something with what I learn <em>(well, this is kind of a
                demonstration isn't it?)</em></li>
        <li>Someone who has lots of different interests :)</li>
    </ul>
